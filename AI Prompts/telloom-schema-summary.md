# Schema Summary

## Overview

The schema models a platform where users can assume multiple roles and interact with content, subscriptions, and other users. The main components are:

- User Profiles and Roles
- Content Models
- Subscription and Purchase Models
- Auxiliary Models

## How It Works Together

### User Roles and Interactions

- Multiple Roles per User: Assigned via ProfileRole.
- Sharers:
  - Create and manage content.
  - Invite Listeners and Executors.
  - Assign one Executor.
- Executors:
  - Manage content for assigned Sharers.
  - Invite additional Listeners.
  - Can serve multiple Sharers.
- Listeners:
  - View content from followed Sharers.
  - Follow via accepted invitations (ProfileListener).
  - Can follow multiple Sharers.
- Admins:
  - Have elevated privileges.

### Key Relationships and Interactions

- Invitations:
  - Sharers or Executors send invitations via email.
  - Invitees accept using a unique token.
  - Upon acceptance, they are assigned the appropriate role and relationships are established.
- Content Management:
  - Sharers create content linked to their ProfileSharer.
  - Executors gain rights to manage a Sharer's content after being assigned.
- Access Control:
  - Listeners must accept an invitation to view a Sharer's content.
  - Access is managed via the ProfileListener relationship.
  - Executors have permissions tied to their relationship in ProfileExecutor.
  - Role Checks enforce permissions for actions like content creation, editing, and deletion.

### Summary of Workflow

1. User Registration:
   - A new user creates a Profile.
   - Roles can be assigned upon registration or later.
2. Assigning Roles:
   - Roles are linked via the ProfileRole model.
3. Inviting Others:
   - Sharers invite Listeners and Executors using the Invitation model.
   - Invitations are sent via email with a unique token.
4. Establishing Relationships:
   - Upon accepting an invitation, a ProfileListener or ProfileExecutor record is created.
   - This sets up the necessary permissions and access controls.
5. Content Interaction:
   - Sharers create content that Listeners can view.
   - Executors manage the Sharer's content as needed.
6. Role-Based Permissions:
   - Actions are permitted based on the user's roles and relationships.
   - The schema enforces constraints to maintain data integrity and proper access.
